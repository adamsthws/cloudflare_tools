Description: Updates a Cloudflare DNS A record with the external IP of the source machine
Author: Adam Matthews

WHAT IT DOES
It compares the current external (WAN) IP address of the machine with the DNS IP record of the domain.
If different, it updates the domain's DNS A record at cloudflare to relect the machine's IP.
Similar to DuckDNS / No-IP / DynDNS but using your own domain on Cloudflare.
